Code works file in Codepen.io as two different pages - one English, one Deutsch - with the corresponding html & css files.
Have installed XAMPP on my laptop as a local web server.
Under C:\xampp\htdocs have created two folders - recipe_page_eng and recipe_page. Each folder has "index.html" and "styles.css" with correspoding html and css code.
Apache module needs to be running for webpages "http://localhost/recipe_page_eng/" and "http://localhost/recipe_page_deu/" to work.
