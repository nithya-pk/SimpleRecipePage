			<p> I love to cook! I consider my mom to be the best cook ever, but I am also a good one. I cook pizza & pasta and have learnt baking different kinds of cakes (without eggs), but my favourite cuisine is Indian. In this page, I am sharing some of my most liked recipes from different parts of India - these are regulars on our dining table!

			<h3>Steps:</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Take poha in a large strainer. Wash it 1-2 times by gently shifting them with your fingers under running water. Drain the excess water through a strainer. Sprinkle salt and sugar (optional) over it, mix/toss well and keep aside.</li>
			<li>Heat 2-tablespoons oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds; when they start to splutter, add cumin seeds, green chilies, curry leaves, peanuts and a pinch of asafoetida. Allow them to sizzle until chillies turn crisp for approx. 30-40 seconds.</li>
			<li>Add chopped onions and sauté until onions turn translucent.</li>
			<li>Add chopped potatoes and salt (add salt only for potatoes).</li>
			<li>Mix well and cook covered until potatoes turn tender. This will take around 3-4 minutes. Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
			<li>Add turmeric powder.</li>
			<li>Mix well and cook for a minute.</li>	
			<li>Add soaked poha.</li>
			<li>Mix well.</li>
			<li>Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add lemon juice, dry grated coconut and finely chopped coriander leaves.</li>
			<li>Mix well and turn off the flame. Poha is ready for serving.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="tips">Tips:</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Do not soak poha in water. Just gently wash them thoroughly under running water and place them in a strainer to drip away excess water. </li>
			<li>If you don’t have a strainer, just sprinkle small amount of water over rice flakes and let them soak. Don’t use excess water. After soaking, poha should be moist but not wet.</li>
			<li>Use medium thick rice flakes. Don’t use very thin rice flakes. You can also use brown rice poha.</li>
			<li>Adjust  quantity of Sugar to your liking for just a hint / higher sweetness.</li>
			<li>Different kinds of fine chopped vegetables like carrots, peas, capsicum or any other of your choice can be added. Make sure you adjust cooking times for vegetables accordingly.</li>

		<div class="kosambari">
			<h2 id="kosambari">Kosambari</h2>
			<p> Moong dal Kosambari (or only "Kosambari") is a South Indian salad from Karnataka that is a part of every festive meal and celebration. It is distributed to masses during Ganesha Chaturthi and Sri Rama Navami.
			It is made using soaked split yellow moong dal, grated carrot and grated coconut. Lemon Juice is added to give a slight tangy taste. A tempering of curry leaves, hing, and red chili lift this dish. 
			South Indians eat this salad as it is or with hot steamed rice and rasam or serve with hot Masala Chai during tea time.
